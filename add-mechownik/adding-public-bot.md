# Adding Public Bot

To add our public bot to your discord server click link under the text and follow instructions:

{% embed url="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1101105727340286022&permissions=8&scope=bot" %}

When bot is on your discord server go to settings > roles and drag "Mechownik" role above members role. Without bot commands like /ban, /kick and /mute and everything related to member moderation will stop working.&#x20;
