# Running bot

Running bot:

Before you start bot, you need to install packages using this command (This step is required only after installing new version or first start):

```
npm install
```



There are three commands you can run to start the bot:\
\
Command 1, Run with nodemon(Recomended):

```bash
npx nodemon main.js
```

Command 2, Run with npm package manager:

```bash
npm run run
```

Command 3, Run directly with node.js:

```bash
node main.js
```

Now bot is running, go to next page to invite it to your server:

{% content-ref url="inviting-bot-to-your-server.md" %}
[inviting-bot-to-your-server.md](inviting-bot-to-your-server.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
